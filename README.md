# Numbered-List-Generator
This is a small C application which can generate numbered lists

The format string (argument one) takes a string with ? as the replacer. There is also a START (optional: default=0), END, and STEP (optional: default=1) parameter. You can use ```\``` as an escape character.

USAGE: generator [FSTRING] [optional: START] [END] [optional: STEP]
